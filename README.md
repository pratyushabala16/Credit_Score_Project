# Credit_score_prediction_project

 Over the years, a global finance company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts.
Our task is , given a personâ€™s credit-related information, we have to build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.

* I will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis to extract the key insights on how different parameters are related to the different credit score brackets of the customers.
* Then on the next step, I will apply Classification models like Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost to predict the credit score classes.
* Lastly I will compare their predicition accuracy and make some inferences.
